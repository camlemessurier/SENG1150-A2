This following document sets forth the Privacy Policy for the Service U website, http://www.serviceU.com.<br><br>

      </p>

      <h2>Collection of your personal information</h2>
      <p>
        There are many aspects of the site which can be viewed without providing personal information, however, for access to future Service U customer support features you are required to submit personally identifiable information.

      </p>
      <h2>Sharing of your personal information</h2>
      <p>
          We may occasionally hire other companies to provide services on our behalf, including but not limited to handling customer support enquiries, processing transactions or customer freight shipping. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. Service U takes reasonable steps to ensure that these organisations are bound by confidentiality and privacy obligations in relation to the protection of your personal information.

If our information practices change at some time in the future we will use for these new purposes only, data collected from the time of the policy change forward will adhere to our updated practices.
      </p>
